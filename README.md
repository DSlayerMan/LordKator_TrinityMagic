# LordKator_TrinityMagic
Play server admin interface for https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore

The purpose of this project is to support playing on a TrinityCore server as blizzlike as possible but, with admin permissions. The reality of TrinityCore at 3.3.5 is that some quests are broken and in 3.3.5 some things are just plain annoying (find 30 of these for each person in your group.. yea no thanks).

This is not designed to be some sort of tool a community server might give to their population, it assumes the person with the tool has full admin permissions. Maybe in the future it can take into consideration the user's actual permissions.
